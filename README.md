# Machine Learning Study Path

This repository will be my attempt to make hands-on python machine learning easier to grasp.  

## Getting Started

I will try to keep adding more projects on a daily basis so stay tuned. Most of these projets will initially be a black box approach focusing mainly on data handling and preprocessing. Later on each module will have a barebones represention in another repo.

### Prerequisites

Python3,numpy,pandas and scikit-learn.
The datasets will be downloaded through url's for now.(csv,tsv)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

For Linux distributions
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
```
For Windows just add append ```py -m``` before the above commands

## Cloning 

Clone the repo using 
```git clone https://github.com/AshwinB-hat/Machine_Learning_LearningPath ```
